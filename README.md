# Hi, I'm Jasmine (Anh) Pham [she/her/hers]

I am an agile-minded data professional who is passionate, cross-functional, and goal-oriented. While I have a strong aptitude for technical and statistical tasks, I am ultimately driven to create sustainable and equitable solutions that result in socially meaningful transformations.

After 3 years working in the industry, I decided to go back to school to further enhance my foundational knowledge and hone my skill set in data science. I'm currently a Master's student in Data Science at Boston University with an expected graduation date in December 2024.
